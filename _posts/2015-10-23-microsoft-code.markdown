I started using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) a couple days ago, and I have to say, I actually love it.

In the past I've used Sublime Text, Atom, WebStorm, and Vim. They're all great editors with their own shortcomings, but I think Microsoft has done an excellent job at providing something that has very nice default features built it, but still allows for a good amount of customization.

Code has built in syntax support for just about everything a web developer would need (javascript, scss, handlebars, html, json, markdown, etc.). It also supports eslint and jshint out of the box, you just need to be enabled via a settings.json file for a project (you can also disable the default javascript checker, which I found helpful).

The snippet support is also very good, and I think much easier to use than anything else I've seen. The format is just straight json, and there's a snippet file per language.

Suprisingly, it has a great node debugging tool built in. If you've ever tried using the node debugger via the command line or in another editor, you'd know that getting it to run and do what you want can be a struggle. But, Code provides a nice tab to setup the debugger and a .json file for customizing the run options.

From a performance perspective, it's very good. One of the reasons I left Atom was because you could tell you were editing in something that was written in a non native language, but with Code, I actually thought it was a native application until I noticed the option to show the Chromium developer tools.

There's a ton of other features I'm not mentioned, but I'd highly recommend giving Code a shot. Out of all the editors I've used, I'd say Code is by far the best at getting a developer to be productive as quickly as possible. I'd be surprised if you struggle getting to be productive with it in less than an hour, even if you've spent years customizing Vim/Atom/Sublime Text. It's fast, has excellent default features and...it just works!

Finally, it's great to see one of (if not the best) software company in the world creating something that isn't full of bloat and has the potential to be embraced by developers outside of the enterprise. Kudos to Microsoft.
